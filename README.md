This feature integrates multiple APIs, including OpenWeather for weather data and Nominatim for geolocation, ensuring accurate address and weather information is collected. User authentication is managed through protected routes, ensuring that only logged-in users can submit reports. Axios is used for making API requests to fetch weather and location data, as well as submitting reports to the server. Upon submission, reports are stored in the `ReportAuthorities` table in the database, linking each report to the corresponding user through the user ID. | Completed    |
| **Tracking and Interaction**      | Implemented a tracking mechanism for the status and progress of each report, enhancing user engagement with the reporting process. This includes the ability to filter reported issues by status (reported, in progress, resolved) and display associated data such as weather information for each issue. Weather data is stored for each report based on the latitude and longitude of the reported location. Additionally, it sets the default position of the React Leaflet map using the report's latitude and longitude, utilizing OpenStreetMap API for map rendering. | Completed |
| **Spotify API Integration**       | Allowing users to share their favorite songs or playlists with the NeighborhoodAid community, fostering a sense of shared community through music. | In Progress  |

### Database Migrations and Enhancements
| **Component**             | **Description**                                                                                                    | **Status**  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **User Table Migration**  | Updated migration for the `Users` table to check for table existence before creation, ensuring schema consistency across environments. | Completed  |
| **Feeds and Comments**    | Enhanced migrations for `Feeds` and `Comments` tables with validation and schema checks to maintain data integrity. | Completed  |
| **ReportAuthorities**     | Developed a new migration for the `ReportAuthorities` table, including relevant fields like latitude and longitude. Ensured table creation only if it doesnâ€™t already exist. | Completed  |
| **CommunityReports**      | Added migration for the `CommunityReports` table without weather details, ensuring creation only if not already present. | Completed  |

### Next Steps
- **Backend Enhancements**: Continue building the API to support the new reporting and tracking features.
- **UI/UX Updates**: Improve the user interface for a seamless and intuitive experience when interacting with reports and community features.
- **API Integrations**: Finalize the Spotify API integration to create engaging music-sharing features within the neighborhood community.

### Notes
NeighborhoodAid is evolving with a focus on strengthening community engagement through efficient reporting systems and shared neighborhood experiences. Under Mirasol Davilaâ€™s continued leadership, the project aims to expand its capabilities, ensuring it meets user needs effectively and fosters a connected community environment.

**Reflection**: The progress achieved in such a short timeframe highlights the collaborative spirit and dedication to delivering a meaningful platform. Version 2.0 will build upon this momentum, ensuring NeighborhoodAid becomes a robust and user-friendly tool for communities.
